**Wordbook** is an offline English-English dictionary application built for GNOME, and powered by [Open English WordNet](https://github.com/globalwordnet/english-wordnet) and eSpeak-ng. It was originally made as an alternative to WordWeb on Windows.

Currently has over 25,000 installs on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.mufeed.Wordbook/). I'm also working on getting [Wordbook into the GNOME Circle](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle/-/issues/82).
