**Dialect** is a translation application targeted at the GNOME desktop, but also compatible with the free desktop ecosystem in general. It is designed to support multiple online translation sources such as LibreTranslate, DeepL, Google, Lingva Translate, Bing, Yandex and others.

Dialect supports other handy features like translation history, text to speech and clipboard integration as well.

We also host a few different translation services ourselves that you can make use of, even if you don't want to use Dialect. You can find the list of services and a lot other details on the [Dialect website](https://dialectapp.org).

Currently has over 180,000 installs on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/app.drey.Dialect/) and is a part of [GNOME Circle](https://apps.gnome.org/Dialect/).
