**Dialect** is a translation application targeted at the GNOME desktop, but also compatible with the free desktop ecosystem in general. It is designed to support multiple online translation sources such as LibreTranslate, DeepL, Google, Lingva Translate, Bing, Yandex and others.

It also supports other handy features like translation history, text to speech and clipboard integration.

We also host a few different translation services ourselves that you can make use of, even as a non-GNOME user. You can find the list of services and a lot other details on the [Dialect website](https://dialectapp.org).

Currently has over 170,000 installs on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.mufeed.Wordbook/) and is a part of [GNOME Circle](https://apps.gnome.org/Dialect/).
