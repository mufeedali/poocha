This is my personal website, where I share my projects, blog posts, and other things I find interesting. It serves as a portfolio of my work and a place to express my thoughts.

- Built using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator in Rust.
- The theme is custom-built with a **semi-retro** aesthetic, blending some modern styling with Pixel art-ish design.
- Each icon was hand-drawn using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/).
- Makes use of the [Catppuccin color palette](https://catppuccin.com/palette/). Hence the site name `Poocha` (Malayalam for Cat) and theme name `Cat`.
- Each page is supposed to be under 15 KB. This *might* stop being a thing in the future, but I like the idea of a lightweight site.
- Hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
- Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mufeedali/poocha).
