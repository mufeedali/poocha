Wordbook just got a major upgrade and is now part of the [GNOME Circle](https://apps.gnome.org/Wordbook/)! This release brings significant UI improvements and several new features:

**What's New:**

- **UI Redesign** so that Wordbook hopefully looks a lot nicer now.
- **Favorites** so you can save words you want to revisit.
- **"Did you mean" suggestions** for when you make an oopsy.
- **Auto-paste clipboard content** on launch if you live a fast life.
- **GNOME Search Provider** so you can search words directly from the overview.
- **Persistent history** upto 20 entries with better management.
- **Significant performance & responsiveness improvements**.
- **Better keyboard navigation & accessibility**.

{% callout(type="warning", title="BREAKING") %}
The Settings schema has changed, so you will lose any settings you had.
{% end %}

I plan to write later about why this took so long. But for now, thatâ€™s it.

Get it on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/dev.mufeed.Wordbook).
