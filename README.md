# WIP Personal Website

# Theme

Starting with the theme.

## To-Do

- [ ] Needs better accessibility.
- [ ] Needs more templating features:
    - [ ] Light/Dark Images
    - [ ] Profile features
- [ ] Optimize how SVGs are loaded. Maybe using symbol ids to deduplicate them?
- [ ] The crates icon looked a lot better in the preview. Looks horrible on the site.
